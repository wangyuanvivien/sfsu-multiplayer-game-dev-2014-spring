= Account Creation =
 # To create an account, new users clicks “Register” from login screen. This brings up a form asking for basic information:
   * Username (check for availability, if appropriate)
   * Password (requirements?)
   * Email
   * Birthday (bonus?)
 # After account is created, game is started.
 # Options for “about” and “help”
 # Explain Game rules (As shown in [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Wl9s4cjVPGfXoPV-jAs4sWMffvrDyvkJ44gA7kB5SqM/edit#slide=id.g2c22e1e92_030/ Steven’s slideshow])

= Game Mechanics =
==Map==
All players play on a persistent map:
 # The map consists of 16807 concentric hexagonal tiles.
 # Each player owns tiles and plays to expand the tiles they control.
 # <image>
 # The map will utilize a 3-dimensional coordinate system described towards the end of [http://keekerdc.com/2011/03/hexagon-grids-coordinate-systems-and-distance-calculations/ this article].
 # ===Tiles===
   * Each hexagon tile has a *Vegetation Capacity* between 100 to 1000 *Biomass Points*.
     * Different terrain types have different *Vegetation Capacity*, i.e. a desert tile has a 100 vegetation biomass unit capacity where a plains tile has 500 and a tile with a river has 1000.
   * The amount biomass of vegetation in a player’s personal ecosystem is limited by the sum of the *Vegetation Capacity* of the tiles they own.
   * Players will be able to select tiles from the map screen to view more detailed information. Information presented will depend on ownership of the tile.
     * Players will be able to see detailed information about their own ecosystem when selecting tiles they own
     * Tiles owned by another player or unowned tiles will only show general information:
       * Tile ownership
       * Vegetation Capacity

==Personal Ecosystem Care==
Players try to maintain a persistent ecosystem of species they can use to conquer other tiles.
 # Each player starts with ownership of a single hexagon tile and 1000 *Biomass Points* to spend on creating an initial *Personal Ecosystem*.
 # *Personal Ecosystems* will be updated every 5 minutes whether the player is online or not.
 # Each update will progress the simulation of the *Personal Ecosystem* by 3 months. 
 # The ecosystem healths of all the players are checked every update and each player will be assigned an *Environment Score* that ranges around 10,000 points.
 # Players will be awarded 1% of the *Environment Score* in *Biomass Points*.
 # ===Spending Biomass Points===
   * Players can use *Biomass Points* to introduce more biomass into their ecosystem.
   * 1 *Biomass Point* can purchase 1 biomass unit of a species.
   * Vegetation can not be purchased if the total amount of vegetation biomass in their ecosystem after the purchase exceeds the sum of the *Vegetation Capacity* of the tiles they own.
   * All species have minimum amounts to purchase that reflect their real-life size; large species have a higher minimum than small species.
     * ex. Lions must be bought in 800 biomass unit chunks, trees are bought in several thousand biomass unit chunks, while insects and small plants can be bought in single biomass unit chunks.

==Battle for Tiles==
  Players can expand their ecosystem size by conquering tiles to add to their *Vegetation Capacity*.

   * ===Declaring Battle===
     # Players can attack from a tile they own to an adjacent tile.
     # When a player declares battle on another tile, one of two types of battle will begin: a *Direct Battle* or a *Proxy Battle*
     # The type of battle depends on the following:
       * The battle is a *Direct Battle* if the tile being attacked is owned and the owner is online and accepts the battle within one minute.
       * The battle is a *Proxy Battle* if the tile being attacked is unowned, or the tile is owned and either the owner is offline or the owner does not accept the battle within one minute.
     # Attackers in a *Proxy Battle* join a global queue where they will be matched up to battle.

   * ===Building a Battle-Ecosystem===
     * Once battle is initiated, players have 3 minutes to build a *Battle Ecosystem*.
     * The *Battle Ecosystem* will be built by taking biomass of species from their *Personal Ecosystem*.
     * The *Vegetation Capacity* of the player's *Battle-Ecosystem* is the *Vegetation Capacity* of the tile they are battling from.
     * Transfer of species to the *Battle Ecosystem* must comply with *Vegetation Capacity* maximums and species biomass minimums described in [GameRules#Spending_Biomass_Points].
     * ====Default Battle Ecosystem====
       * To assist the player, they will be provided a with a default *Battle Ecosystem* to modify.
       * The *Default Battle Ecosystem* is identical to their own *Personal Ecosystem* but with a size proportional to the *Vegetation Capacity* of the tile they’re battling from in comparison to the entire *Vegetation Capacity* of their *Personal Ecosystem*.
         * ex. If the player has 1000 biomass units of *Vegetation Capacity* containing 500 biomass units of crickets and 1000 biomass of grass in their *Personal Ecosystem* and is battling from a tile with 500 biomass units of *Vegetation Capacity*, their *Default Battle Ecosystem* will be comprised of an ecosystem containing half of the biomass in their *Personal Ecosystem* (500 biomass units in the tile used to battle divided by the 1000 biomass units of total *Vegetation Capacity* = 1/2) and will be comprised of 250 biomass units of crickets and 500 biomass units of grass.
      * Species will be rounded or excluded from the *Default Battle Ecosystem* to meet the minimum species biomass requirement.
        * ex. If in the previous example the *Default Battle Ecosystem* contained 500 biomass of a hog instead of crickets, it would be excluded because it requires 300 biomass units minimum which is higher than the 250 proportional biomass units the *Default Battle Ecosystem* would contain; likewise, if hogs had a minimum of 150 biomass units, then only 150 biomass units would be added as 300 biomass units would also be more the proportional amount.

   * ===Waging Battle===
     * Battle turns consists of the following three steps:
     # ====Progressing Time====
       * At the start of each turn the simulation time of the *Battle Ecosystems* progresses 3 months.
       * The ecosystem healths of the players are checked every turn and each player will be assigned a *Battle Environment Score* that ranges around 10,000 points.
       * Players will be awarded 1% of the environment score in *Battle Biomass Points*.
     # ====Attack Stage====
       * During a turn, each player can spend *Battle Biomass Points* to make any amount of four movements :
         # Retreat biomass of species from the *Battle Ecosystem* back into their *Personal Ecosystem*.
         # Transfer biomass from their *Personal Ecosystem* into their Battle Ecosystem.
         # Destroy biomass in their opponent’s *Battle Ecosystem*.
         # Transfer biomass from their *Battle Ecosystem* into their opponent’s *Battle Ecosystem*.
       * Every unit of biomass transferred or destroyed cost 1 *Battle Biomass Point*.
       * Transfer of species from the player’s *Battle Ecosystem* to either the player’s *Personal Ecosystem* or the opponent’s *Battle Ecosystem* must comply with *Vegetation Capacity* maximums and species biomass minimums described in [GameRules#Spending_Biomass_Points].
     # ====Ending the Turn====
       * Both players move simultaneously.
       * Neither player can see their opponent’s moves during the turn.
       * After a player finishes their moves they consent to end the turn.
       * The turn ends when both players consent or a one minute time limit elapses.

   * ===Ending Battle===
     * Battle ends after 10 turns or when a battling player’s *Battle Ecosystem* collapses.
     * At the end of the battle, the player with the highest *Battle Environment Score* wins.
     * The loser of the battle forfeits the biomass used in the their *Battle Ecosystem* to the winner.

   * ===Updating Tile Control===
     * Tile control is updated depending on the battle type:
       * For *Direct Battles*: The loser forfeits control of the tile they battled from to the winner.
       * For *Proxy Battles*: Only the winner gains control of the tile they attacked.
