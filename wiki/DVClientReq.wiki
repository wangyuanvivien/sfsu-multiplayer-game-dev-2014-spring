==Requirements==
  * Design and implement charts and graphs to display data about the ecosystem
  * Have buttons to allow the user to choose what information to display
  * Draw graphs using data obtained from database
  * Create a graph for predator/prey interaction
  * Grab data from the server for each graph

==Implementation==
Objects needed:
  * PlayerData: 
    * Displays the current biomass/species, tiles owned, environment score
  * TopPlayerData
    * Current biomass/species, tiles owned, environment score
  * Graph: 
    * Parent of all graphs
    * Object that draws a graph depending on the data given to it
    * Biomass Graph: Biomass over time
    * Predator/Prey interactions Graph: Charts relationship between two species and their populationâ€™s changes over time
    * Species Quantities and Events Graph: Events that affect species such as births, deaths, poached
    * Battle Graph: Shows the differences between you and your opponents battle environments
  * TileData:
    * onMouseHoverEvent()
      * When a player hovers over a tile, a box will display which includes all the information about the tile selected.
    * Create an OnGUI() event that makes calls to methods and then displays the data
    * Gather the Vegetation Capacity and display it
    * Check if the tile selected is owned by the player or not and display the information associated with ownership
  * BattleData
    * historyOfBattle()
      * Retrieves and display the historical list of turn-statistics
    * Create buttons and make appropriate calls in OnGUI()
  * Update()
    * Update current statistics of the battle that are permanently displayed (turn, battle ecosystem score, biomass, vegetation)
  * Graph()
    * Obtains and presents graph and data

==Milestones==

M1(4/8): Display score, top score, environment point. Remove hard coded code and get actual data from the server to display on the screen.

M2(4/15): Include tabs into the screen. When a user click on the tabs, it will display graphs associated with the tab.

M3(4/28): Display battle data and title data.

M4(5/5): Integrate data visualization into battle scene
