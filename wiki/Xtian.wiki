==Tutorial Team — Protocol==

==Protocol requirements==

Communicate with client and server member on what data they need to transfer by creating appropriate request/response files that transfer data between client and server in order to get essential ingredients to creating data visualizations.

As part of the Protocol team, we will implement a new Protocol which client will use to communicate with the Server.

==Protocol Specifications:==

Request/response data transfer files on both the server and the client so that client is able to have updated data after server runs modifications of data due to certain activities

RequestWorldData—Client requests current world information after player logs in

ResponseWorldData—Collect world information and send to client

RequestTile—Player clicks on a tile, client sends request for info on that tile

ResponseTile—Server responds with tile information, may be stored client side and synced as needed with server database: species on tile, biomass of tile, owner of tile

RequestEcosystem—Player looks up their or other players’ profile, client sends request to server

ResponseEcosystem—Server responds with specified player’s ecosystem information: how many tiles in ecosystem, total number of species in ecosystem (fragmented and continuous)

RequestBattle—Player engages in battle with another player

ResponseBattle—Battle system sets up battle and responds with necessary response for both players

RequestMessage—Player types a message in chat and clicks send / Player logs in

ResponseMessage—Game displays message(s) in chat

RequestTutorial—If a player has just registered, allow for optional tutorial scene or if player clicks on a tutorial button

ResponseTutorial—Send player’s client view to Tutorial mode, maybe store player’s progress to database (persistent level carryover from tutorial)

RequestSpecies—Player requests species information

ResponseSpecies—Respond with corresponding information for given species
