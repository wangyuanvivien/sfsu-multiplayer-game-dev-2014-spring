#summary Requirement documentation: Data visualization & Protocol (lead)

= Requirements =

Protocol (Lead) Requirements:
- Communicate with client and server member on what data they need to transfer (by creating appropriate request/response files that transfer data between client and server in order to get essential ingredients to creating data visualizations

- Be able to communicate with protocol members to figure out if there are any shared networking (request/response) files for transferring similar data manipulations.

Data Visualization Requirements:

	- Player data (including environmental score)

	- Biomass graph: Player is able to see change in environment/ecosystem over time

	- Species’ interactions graph: Analytics of species’ health in relation to predators/prey.
 
	- Species’ quantities & events graph: Shows number of species over time, with specific events that may have affected the species (e.g. # of purchases, births, eaten, poached)

	- Tile data, battle data, and other miscellaneous data

Protocol Specifications for Data Visualization:
	- Request/response data transfer files on both the server and the client so that client is able to have updated data after server runs modifications of data due to certain activities

-	  RequestPlayerData()/ResponsePlayerData()
		        RequestBiomassGraph()/ResponseBiomassGraph()
		        RequestSpeciesInteraction()/ResponseSpeciesInteraction()
		        RequestSpeciesQuantity()/ResponseSpeciesQuantity()
		        RequestTileData()/ResponseTileData()
		        RequestBattleData()/ResponseBattleData()

Milestones:
#1 tentatively due 4/10
	- All request/response files necessary for server and client to run appropriately 
-  RequestPlayerData()/ResponsePlayerData() 

#2 tentatively due 4/24
	- Key request/response files necessary for capability of data visualization component
		- RequestBiomassGraph()/ResponseBiomassGraph(), 
  RequestSpeciesInteraction()/ResponseSpeciesInteraction(), 
  RequestSpeciesQuantity()/ResponseSpeciesQuantity()

#3 tentatively due 5/8
	- Request/response files used for data visualization of less essential data
- RequestTileData()/ResponseTileData()
		   RequestBattleData()/ResponseBattleData()
