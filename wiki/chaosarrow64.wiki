*Natural Environment Component Team*

*Content Technical Team*

Revised: 28 March 2014

== 1.  High-Level Tasks ==

=== Content tasks: ===
  * Create a UI to simplify interaction with the simulation engine
  * Test various combinations of species using the simulation engine to determine which combinations result in a balanced ecosystem
  * Find acceptable modifiers for terrains’ effects on species’ biomass and growth rates
  * Find acceptable modifiers for natural events’ effects on species’ biomass and growth rates
  * Find acceptable modifiers for seasons’ effects on species’ biomass and growth rates

=== Natural Environment tasks: ===
  * Finalize list of natural environment elements to include in high-priority tasks
  * Define objects required for each element
  * Implement terrain effect objects
  * Implement high-priority natural event objects
  * Implement season objects


== 2.  Objects to Be Implemented ==

=== Content objects ===

*SimJob*
  * Loads jobs to be sent to the simulation engine

*SimResults*
  * Imports results from simulation engine to a human-readable format

*Database for Simulation Results*
  * Organized and centralized location for all collected data

=== Natural Environment objects ===

*Terrain*

Modifies species’ biomass and growth rate according to terrain

Types include: Desert, Jungle, Grasslands, Arctic

  * getTerrainType( )
  * getModifier( )

*NaturalEvent (Abstract)*

Modifies species’ biomass and growth rate according to natural events
  * getEventType( )
  * getModifier( )

*Fire (extends NaturalEvent)*

Randomly occurs, may be affected by terrain and seasons

*Flood (extends NaturalEvent)*

Randomly occurs, may be affected by terrain and seasons

*Rain (extends NaturalEvent)*

Randomly occurs, may be affected by terrain and seasons

*Season*

Modifies species’ biomass and growth rate according to changes in seasons

Seasons include: Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter

  * getSeason( )
  * getModifier( )
